## Runtime analysis of algorithms
A runtime analysis focuses on finding the rate of increase in complexity of an algorithms with respect to input(s).

There are two kinds of runtime analysis that can be used to rate algorithms.
1. Time complexity analysis
2. Space complexity analysis

### Time Complexity
Time complexity can be briefly defined as the rate of growth of `cpu` time required by an algorithm with respect to it's input.

### Space Complexity
Space complexity can be briefly defined as the rate of growth of `memory` required by an algorithm with respect to it's input.

For now, this section of the repository focuses on space complexity.
