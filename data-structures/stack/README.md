## Stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that has `LIFO` characteristics (Last in First Out).

### Operations provided in a stack implementation
1. **push** -> Adds an item at the top of the stack. Results in an overflow if the stack is full.
2. **pop** -> Removes an item from the top of the stack. Results in an underflow if the stack is empty.
3. **peek** -> Returns a reference to the element at the top of the stack. Results in an underflow if the stack is empty.
4. **isEmpty** -> Returns true if stack is empty and has no elements.
